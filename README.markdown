## Synopsis

A simple way to compile SASS and SCSS files on the fly via the URL.

## Installation

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://symphony-cms.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://symphony-cms.com/learn/>.

## Usage

### Basics

Similar to JIT Image Manipulation: Just include your SCSS stylesheet, say `workspace/assets/style.scss` using

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/scss/assets/style.scss" />

Alternatively, you can use the older, less CSS-like dialect of SASS:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/sass/assets/style.sass" />
